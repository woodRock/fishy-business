  This document gives some ideas about how to write a project
  proposal, and provides a template for a proposal. You should discuss
  your proposal with your supervisor.

\section*{1. Introduction}

In this section you should include a very brief introduction to the
problem to the problem and the project.

Your project proposal should cover the following points:

\begin{itemize}
\item the engineering problem that you are going to solve;
\item how you plan to solve your problem;
\item how you intend to evaluate your solution; and
\item any resource requirements for your project such as software,
  hardware or other resources that will be needed in the course of the
  project.
\end{itemize}

Your proposal should be not more than than 3 pages long.

\section*{2. Literature Review}

In this section you should give a brief description of the problem
itself. You want to briefly explain the problem, why it is important
to solve the problem and define your project aims. After reading this
section, the reader should understand why it is a problem, believe
that it is important to solve and have a clear idea of the aims of
your project.

When describing the aims of the project, you should avoid vague,
unmeasurable words like `analyse', `investigate', `describe', and use
specific, measurable words like `implement', `demonstrate', `show',
`prove'.

For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item[\bf Good] The aim of this project is to implement and evaluate a
  management system for network switches;
\end{itemize}
is much better than:
\begin{itemize}
\item[\bf Bad] The aim of this project is to investigate management
  systems for network switches.
\end{itemize}

In the second case there is no idea of how much work is involved, and
you will never know whether you have finished. You and your supervisor
(and the markers of your project) may have very different ideas about
what such an `investigation' involves. Of course, it is possible that
the task you set yourself is not achievable, but if you are clear from
the outset this is less likely, and will more easily be corrected.

\section*{3. Prelimary Work}

\begin{itemize}
  \item CNN for gas chromatography 
  \item Multi-tree GP Wrapper-based Feature Construction for Gas Chromatography 
  \item Multi-tree GP winner-takes-all classifier for gas chromatography. 
\end{itemize}

\section*{4. Contributions}

\section*{5. Milestones}

\section*{6. Thesis Outline}

\section*{7. Resources}

In this section you will detail any resource requirements such as
hardware, software or access to subjects.
