# Proposal

This is my PhD proposal. In essence a PhD proposal is a plan for a PhD. It provides evidence that I have the ability, knowledge, and necessary preparation to carry out the research. A proposal includes preliminary work, as a demonstration of technical ability required to complete a doctorate.

Mengjie Zhang gave a Proposal Workshop over zoom, see notes [here](https://fishy-business.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minutes.html#proposal-workshop).
