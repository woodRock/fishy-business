        "| 2024-02-26 15:59 | Intra/inter | Updated fitness value to include a normalized sum of <br> intraclass and interclass distance |\n",
        "| 2024-02-14 16:56 | Mass spectra | Applications for MT-GP for rapid mass spectrometry dataset. | |\n",
        "| 2022-08-21 17:30 | Multi-Objective - Onehot Encoding | Change to multi-objective problem, one-vs-all with a tree classifier for each class.<br> Y labels are encoded in onehot encodings, error is absolute difference between $|\\hat{y} - y|$|\n",
        "| 2022-08-22 20:44 | Non-linearity |  Introduce $ round . sigmoid $ to evaluate_classification() method.<br>Previously, we push each tree to predict either a 0 or 1 value with the onehot encoding representation.<br>Now, the non-linearity will map any negative value to a negative class 0, and any positive value to positive class 1.|\n",
        "| 2022-08-22 21:06 | ~~Genetic operators for tree with worst fitness~~ | Only apply the genetic operators, crossover and mutation, to the tree with the worst fitness.<br> This guarantees monotonic improvement for the Multi-tree between generations, the best performing tree remain unaltered.| (Update) This was very slow, and inefficient,<br> basically turned the GP into a single objective,<br>that balances multi-objective fitness functions. |\n",
        "| 2022-08-22 21:15 | Halloffame Equality Operator | Numpy equality function (operators.eq) between two arrays returns the equality element wise,<br>which raises an exception in the if similar() check of the hall of fame. <br> Using a different equality function like numpy.array_equal or numpy.allclose solve this issue.|\n",
        "| 2022-08-22 23:22 | Elitism as aggregate best tree | Perform elitsim by constructing the best tree, as the tree with best fitness from each clas.<br>The goal is to have monotonous improvement across the multiple objective functions.|\n",
        "| 2022-08-22 23:32 | Update fitness for elite | The elitism was not working as intended, as the multi-objectives didn't appear to increase monotnously.<br> This was because the aggregate fitness was not being assigned to the best individual after it was created.<br>Therefore the best invidiual was not passed on to the next generation. |\n",
        "| 2022-08-22 02:28 | staticLimit max height | Rewrite the gp.staticLimit decorator function to handle the Multi-tree representation.<br>Note: size and depth are different values!<br>depth is the maximum length of a root-to-leaf traversal,<br>size is the total number of nodes.|\n",
        "| 2022-08-24 9:37 | Evaluate Mutli-tree train accuracy | Take the classification accuracy as the argmax for the aggregate multitree.<br> 74% training accuracy, which is not ideal, but this shall improve with time.|\n",
        "| 2022-08-25 13:30 | Single-objective fitness | Change the fitness function to a single objective fitness function.<br>This forces the multi-tree GP to find the best tree subset for one-vs-rest classification performance.|\n",
        "| 2022-08-25 20:01 | Fitness = Balanced accuracy + distance measure | Implement the fitness function for MCIFC, but for multi-class classification from (Tran 2019) |\n",
        "| 2022-08-26 21:27 | Sklearn Balanced Accuracy | Changed to the balanced accuracy metric from sklearn.<br>This is much easier to use for now, probably faster than the previous method as well. |\n",
        "| 2022-09-05 17:00 | Reject invalid predictions | Change the fitness function to reject invalid predictioctions outright -<br>e.g. multi-label or zero-label predictions<br>- when computing the balanced accuracy for the fitness function. |\n",
        "| 2022-09-13 19:00 | Mutation + Crossover = 100% | Ensure the mutation and crossover rate sum to 100%,<br>not necessary with deap, but good to avoid conference questions |\n",
        "| 2022-09-13 21:00 | Feature Construction | Changed to Wrapper-based Feature Construction with Multi-tree GP.|\n",
        "| 2022-09-13 21:34 | $m = r \\times c$ | Add more trees, following example from (Tran 2019).<br> With 8 trees for a multi-class classification<br> $m = r \\times c = 8$ trees, where number of classes $c = 4$, and reconstruction ratio $r = 2$/ |\n",
        "| 2022-09-30 19:49 | Quick Evalaute | Manually parse the GP trees, 5x speedup for DEAP in Python (Zhang 2022). |\n",
        "| 2022-10-13 6:02 | Ignore timestamps after 4500 | Ignore timestamps after 4500 did not improve accuracy for SVM classifier.<br>So the bizzare pattern that occurs on GC-MS image there has important information.<br> Should investigate this further, perhaps ask Daniel as he is a domain expert.|\n",
        "| 2022-10-13 22:16 | Cross validation | Evaluate the mean balanced classification accuracy over stratified k-fold cross validation.|\n",
        "| 2023-01-13 20:58 | 2x speedup | Only evaluate test set for verbose alternative of the evaluate_classification method.<br> This results in a 2x speedup in the efficiency of the training regime.|"
