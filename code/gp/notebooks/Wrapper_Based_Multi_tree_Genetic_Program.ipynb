        "| 2022-08-22 23:32 | Update fitness for elite | The elitism was not working as intended, as the multi-objectives didn't appear to increase monotnously.<br> This was because the aggregate fitness was not being assigned to the best individual after it was created.<br>Therefore the best invidiual was not passed on to the next generation. | \n",

        "| 2022-08-25 13:30 | Single-objective fitness | Change the fitness function to a single objective fitness function.<br>This forces the multi-tree GP to find the best tree subset for one-vs-rest classification performance.| \n",
