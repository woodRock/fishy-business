"""A transformer-based gradient boosting ensemble model.

Boosting: In this sequential approach, models are built one after another,
where each new model attempts to correct the errors of its predecessor.
The final prediction is a weighted sum of the predictions of all the models.
Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.

This implementation uses a series of transformer layers as the "weak learners".
The training process should be as follows:
1. Train the first transformer layer on the data.
2. Use the trained layer to make predictions.
3. Calculate the residuals (errors) of the predictions.
4. Train the next transformer layer on the residuals.
5. Repeat for all layers.
The final prediction is the sum of the initial prediction and all subsequent predictions (residuals) scaled by a learning rate.
