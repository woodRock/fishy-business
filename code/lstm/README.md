# Convolutional Neural Network 

This script lets you run a convolutional neural networks (CNN) code on the GPUs.

## Running

To run experiments, you can use the `run.sh` script. This uses the task spooler `ts` command to run 10 experiments with parallel execution on a GPU server.

Example usage:

```bash
$ ./run.sh
```

To run an individual experiment, you can execute the following command. Say we want to perform genetirc programming on the species dataset `-d`, with 50 epochs `-e`.

Example usage:

```bash
$ python3 main.py -d species -e 50
```

## Task Spooler

Task Spooler was originally developed by Lluis Batlle i Rossell but is no longer maintained. The branch introduced here is a fork of the original program with more features including GPU support.

Say we want to execute the main script on the GPU server, with one GPU `-G` per parallel exeuction of that script.

Example usage:

```bash
# ts -G <number-of-gpus> <command>
$ ts -G 1 python3 main.py
```
