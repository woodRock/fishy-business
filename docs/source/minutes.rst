Simular to ENGR401 stuff
    * Dont need slides.
    * Trip check technologies. 
    * Face audience. 
    * Relevant stuff only. 
    * No animations. 
Research Talks 
    * Don't type the script. 
    * Planning, a lot of time before writing slides.

2022-03-07 - DL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Location:** Zoom, **Time**: Monday 3pm-4pm , **Attendees:** Bastiaan Kleign, Jesse Wood, et al. 

Papers: 
    1. Conditional Diffuction Probablistic Model for Speech Enhancment. 
    2. A Study on Speech enhancment on Diffusion Probabilistic Model. 

* Diffusion models got attention for synthesising images (i.e faces, animals). 
* Later, it bet the GAN on standard benchmarks. 
* Train it to add noise, the reverse the process. 
* Diffusion: learning to denoise speech signal. 
* Isotropic gaussian distribution? 
* Learn the signal-to-noise difference, not the mean signal. 
* Diffusion markov chain is intractable, so we use Elbo to from an approximate objective function. 
* Ratios and constants to ensure the mean and variance don't explode or vanish. 
* New Mailing list for DL updates. 
* Next week: Bayesian Transformers.

Jeff Hawkins - Thousand Brains Theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4geanMOsyM

Notes:
    * Voting, similar to droupout, bagged ensemble. 
    * Many models (sub-networks) for the same thing. 
    * Sparse networks, efficient -> noise tolerant. 
    * Only update in one area, without need for back-propagation, doesn't require a full training for each new instance. 
    * Builds a full world model, not a model for each task. 
    * Thousand brain theory - solution to No Free Lunch.
