    * Learn the signal-to-noise difference, not the mean signal. 
    * Diffusion markov chain is intractable, so we use Elbo to from an approximate objective function. 
    * Ratios and constants to ensure the mean and variance don't explode or vanish.

    * Centralized and federated learning. 
    * Evolutionary multi-objecive federated learning. 
    * Evolutionary federated nerual architecture search. 
    * Multi-objective - gives a solution set, as their are tradeoffs between objectives. 
    * Dominance, no X is worse and Y, and X is strictly better than Y for object A. 
    * pareto front (See tegmark2020ai) set of optimal solutions.
        * accuracy, diversity. 
        * Inverse generational distance (IGD).
        * Hypervolume - nadir 
    * Optimize for minimal complexity implies interpretability. 
    * Centralized learning - one database.

A talk on Geometric Semantic Genetic Programming by Qi Chen https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32937-1_3

Notes: 
    * We have published heaps of papers that are highly cites and hot papers according to https://www.webofscience.com/wos/woscc/basic-search toool that the university has access to.
    * Top 1% of papers cited per discipline for computer science journals. 
    * Evolving neural networks with evolutionary computation. 
    * Me: reading psychology papers on how the brain works with memory - hunting for relative simply neuro-science ideas to apply to machine learning. 
    * Geometric smenatic genetic programming (Morgalio 2012, moraglio2012geometric) https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-32937-1_3 
    * Semantic genetic programming methods. 
    * Traditional GP ignores program semantics. 
    * Consequences - ragged gentype-phenotype mapping. 
    * Is it possible to make GP aware about the effects of the program execution? 
    * Semantics: 
        * Semantics differs from syntax. 
        * Semantics related to the problem domain. 
        * Semantics inform program design (Tegmark 2020, tegmark2020ai).
    * Measure semantic distance between current program and target output (multi-dimensional loss function). 
    * Genetic operators: 
        * Semantic aware cross-over (SAC) 
        * Semantic similarity-based cross-over (SSC)
        * Semantic similarity-based mutation (SSM)
        * Senantic tournament selection. 
            * t-test for statistical signfician with assessing selection. 
    * Search directly in the semantci space of the program. 
    * Semnatics of offsrping must sit in between the ntercept between its two parents in semantic space. 
    * Therefore each offspring minimized distance to target semantics. 
    * Each generation gets closer to the target semantics, or atleast closer than the furthest parent. 
    * Independent of data, good effect on improving generalization, althougt not actual claim made in paper. 
    * Geometric semantic programming leads to a unimodel fitness landscape - a cone where the apex is the target semantics. 
        * manhattan distance - square based pyramid.
        * euclidean distance - cone. 
    * Efficient implementation - only store changes to program tree, similar to git version control - except for GSGP. 
    * GSGR Red (reduce), simplify problems by expanding and recomputing. 
    * Locally geometric semantic crossover (LGSX).
        * Make offsrping similar to eachother than their parents. 
    * Random desired operator (RDO), exploit interoperability of instructions, + can be reversed with -, * can be reversed with division, + and * are communicative. 
    * Semantic backpropogation - decomposibility of the process if important for BP. 
    * Angle aware metrics - larger angle metrics iis more likely to generate offspring closer to target semantics. 
    * Permutations GSX and Random Segment Mutation 
    * Semenatic distance (euclidean) is the same as the loss, just looking at it from a different point of view. 
    * Can geometric smeantic programming work in an unsupervised or combinatorial problem? (Possibly not unimodel semantic space)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Location:** Zoom, **Time**: Monday 3pm-4pm , **Attendees:** Bastiaan Kleign, Jesse Wood, Hayden Dyne, et al. 

Talk by Hayden on two papers: 
    * End-to-end driving via conditional imitation learning (Cai 2020, cai2020high) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8460487/
    * High-speed autonomous drifting with deep reinforcement learning (Codevilla 2018, codevilla2018end) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8961997/ 

Notes: 
    * Model-free reinforcement learning - does not rely on human understanding of world and design controllers. 
    * Human driver is the trajectory with is the goal, uses a professional driver playing the game with a steering wheel. 
    * Model performs on different track difficulties. 
    * Reward function is scaled by velocity, so faster lap times are rewarded. 
    * Works for 4 different kinds of vehicles, although the truck struggles to achieve same performance as lighter ones. 
    * Second paper - e2e 
    * Far easier to use real-world data on driving that has already been collected than generate simulation data. 
    * Data augmentation used to help network generalize to new scenarios and edge cases not in the training data.

2022-03-17 - Weekly   
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Location:** Zoom, **Time**: Friday 12pm-1pm , **Attendees:** Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Bach Hoai Nguyen, Jesse Wood. 

Notes:
    * Daniel can draft the chemistry parts for the paper. 
    * Draft the full paper with Bach, then send to Daniel. 
    * Read "From evolutionary computation to the evolution of things" - Nature
    * Can start coding now - explore ideas for ENGR489 and EC on existing data. 
    * Transformers, LSTM, GAN - yet to be applied to GC-MS data in literature. 
    * CNNs for GC, likely due to libraries, hype, understanding, Diffusion of innovation. 
    * Scuba diver experiment for context-dependent memory is a good analogy for noise in ML models.
    * Came up with evolutionary ideas, like sexual selection, but (Miller 1994) did it quite some time ago.
    * Idea for EC, a dynamic environment where complexity increases, classes or features are added - similar to evolution IRL.

Ruwing Jiao suggested a video on Bayesian Optimization from Mark Deisenroth https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SC5_2vkgbA 

Notes: 
    * Recommended background reading on this topic: 
        1. A Tutorial on Bayesian Optimization of Expensive Cost Functions (Brochu 2010, brochu2010tutorial) https://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2599.pdf
        2. Taking the Human Out of theLoop: A Review of Bayesian Optimization (Shahriari 2015, shahriari2015taking) https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7352306
    * Latent Structural Support Vector Machine (Miller 2012) - **TODO** find this paper/project. 
    * Deep learning often involves a lot of hyper-parameter tuning, this is usally done by the practitioner model. 
    * Alternative approaches: 
        * Manual tuning 
        * Grid search 
        * Random search 
        * Black magic (i.e. lr is 1e-3 is "good")
    * Computationally expensive to search for global maximum in hyper-parameter search space. 
    * Globally optimize a black-box approach to evaluate (e.g. cross validatio error for a massive neural network). 
    * Use a probabilistic model to approximate the black-box model for the hyper-parameter search. 
        * create a proxy model - this learns an approximation of the space - with less computational cost to query that space. 
        * referred to ass proxy / approximate / surrogate. 
    * The standard model for optimizing a bayesian model is a gaussian process. 
    * Evaluate the proxy function once, this saves computation. 
    * A gaussian process minimized the uncertainty of the proxy function.
    * It samples the feature space at the minimum value of the shaded area (== uncertainty).
    * It repeats this often, until the proxy function is close enough to the true objective. 
    * Exploration - sample areas with high uncertainty. 
    * Exploitation - sample places with low mean.
