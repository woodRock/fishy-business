2022-03-07 - DL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Location:** Zoom, **Time**: Monday 3pm-4pm , **Attendees:** Bastiaan Kleign, Jesse Wood, et al. 

Papers: 
    1. Conditional Diffuction Probablistic Model for Speech Enhancment. https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05256
    2. A Study on Speech enhancment on Diffusion Probabilistic Model. https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.11876

Notes:
    * Diffusion models got attention for synthesising images (i.e faces, animals). 
    * Later, it bet the GAN on standard benchmarks. https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/49ad23d1ec9fa4bd8d77d02681df5cfa-Abstract.html
    * Train it to add noise, the reverse the process. 
    * Diffusion: learning to denoise speech signal. 
    * Isotropic gaussian distribution? https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1991961/gaussian-distribution-is-isotropic
    * Learn the signal-to-noise difference, not the mean signal. 
    * Diffusion markov chain is intractable, so we use Elbo to from an approximate objective function. 
    * Ratios and constants to ensure the mean and variance don't explode or vanish. 
    * New Mailing list for DL updates. 
    * Next week: Bayesian Transformers.

2022-03-08 - FASLIP 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Location:** Zoom, **Time**: Monday 2pm-4pm , **Attendees:** Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Bach Hoai Nguyen, Jesse Wood et al. 

Jeff Hawkins - Thousand Brains Theory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4geanMOsyM

Notes:
    * Voting, similar to droupout, bagged ensemble. 
    * Many models (sub-networks) for the same thing. 
    * Sparse networks, efficient -> noise tolerant. 
    * Only update in one area, without need for back-propagation, doesn't require a full training for each new instance. 
    * Builds a full world model, not a model for each task. 
    * Thousand brain theory - solution to No Free Lunch. 

2022-03-08 - ECRG 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
**Location:** Zoom, **Time**: Friday 3pm-5pm , **Attendees:** Bing Xue, Mengjie Zhang, Hui Ma, Bach Hoai Nguyen, Jesse Wood et al. 

Hui Ma gave presentation on Evolutionary Computation Approaches to Web Service Composition - https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10732-017-9330-4

Notes:
    * Meng will discuss how to write a proposal. 
    * EuroGP conference - ask my supervisor to register. 
    * Introduced myself to the group 
        * paper - finish writing my Summer Research paper. 
        * enrolled - lots of paper work. 
        * Finish writing the paper properly. 
    * Abdullah (lab neighbour) first week in group.
    * Evolutionary Computation Approaches to Web Service Composition. 
    * Over 40 publications in the area. 
    * Holidy booking service used as an example. 
    * Organize services into re-usable modules. 
    * Service composition is a NP-hard problem. 
    * A global search is not possible, a heuristic based local search is required. 
    * Evolutionary principles and techniques - crossover, mutation.
    * Automatcally create hybrid services through composition. 
    * Don't reinvent the wheel, use existing libraries instead. 
    * Scheduling, routing, resource allocation, service composition - all possible for EC.
