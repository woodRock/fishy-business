    * Not guilty by reason of insanity (NGRI) - 41 murders studied. 
    * Pre-frontal cortex controls goal oriented behaviour - delayed gratification. 
    * NGRI had different brain chemistry in their pre-frontal cortex. 
    * Pre-disposition to impulse violent behaviour due to brain chemistry. 

(Rain 1997) shows that different brain chemistry can result in unwanted behaviour (murder).
The structure of the model limits is ability to understand abstract concepts. 
Humans with abnormal pre-frontal cortex lack the ability to make goal-oriented decisions. 
Reinforcment learning, job scheduling and other AI problems also fail at capturing the complexity of delayed gratification.
Perhaps, the circuitry involved in a functioning pre-frontal cortex can be translated into reinforcment learning.

    * Elaborative rehearsal is deeper processing than maintenance rehearsal. 
    * Elaborative rehearsal is drawing examples, and similarities to known things. 
    * Reinforcing and creating new synapses to existing patterns. 

(Craik 1972) shows that there are different levels of depth of processing.
Strengthening connections to existing neurons make it easier to encode information in long-term memory. 
We can build knowledge easier from existing context, no need to reinvent the wheel. 
This translates to LSTM models, pre-training (i.e. BERT), Thousand Brain Theory, etc. 
Models with deeper processing are more likely to be able synthesis information for challenging unseen data. 
Deeper processing involves elaborative rehearsal, which makes use of existing synapses, rather than training from scratch each time.

    * Deep processing increased later recall of words.
    * Semantic understanding is deeper than structural or phonetic.
    * Deep processing involves elaborative rehearsal - i.e. reading to stop and think when a thought comes.  
    * Skim-reading doesn't work when compared to thoughful and slow reading. 

(Craik 1972) shows that deep processing leads to better recall. 
A brain is able to remember more if we associate semantic meaning and context with the task. 
For a task, semantic meaning and context can remain static, while new training instances are dynamic. 
In machine learning, we can combine natural language processing (NLP) with existing tasks for greater model representation.
Examples include the combination of metadata NLP and computer vision for image dataset problems like classification, segmentation, detection.

    * Levels of expertise correspond to depth of mental representations. 
    * Chess experts can recognise logical board combinations better than intermediates or novices. 
    * All expertise levels fail to recognise illogical board positions (noise).
    * Expertise provides schemas as meaning representations of logical patterns. 

(Chase 1973) shows that model representations from domain experts fail on illogical scenarios. 
This work shows that the human brain cannot generalize on noise.
The analogy provides a concrete example of intelligence in humans that also translates to artificaical intelligence. 
This is a limitation of existing machine learning models, they struggle to perform well on unseen data.
