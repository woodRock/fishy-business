# Fish + AI Business

## Fish-Nose

Fish have super good noses that can smell all kinds of things! Well, we made a computer fish nose that can smell fish too! This fish nose machine can smell what kind of fish it is, like if it's a Hoki fish or a Mackerel fish. It can even smell which part of the fish it's sniffing, like the head or the tail. Sometimes the fish get mixed together by accident and the fish nose sniffs that out too!

If stinky oil from a boat leaks onto the fish, the fish nose machine can smell that - yuck! It's good at finding fish that got oily and shouldn't be eaten. The best part is the fish nose knows each fish apart by their smell, like Sally the Hoki and Sammy the Mackerel! Our fish nose makes sure all the fish stay safe to eat. Pretty cool huh?
