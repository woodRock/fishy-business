## EvoStar

EvoApplications, the International Conference on the Applications of Evolutionary Computation -formerly known as EvoWorkshops- brings together researchers in applications of Evolutionary Computation and other Nature-inspired techniques.

EvoApplications invites high quality contributions for its 26th edition, which will be held as part of the EvoStar 2023 event and co-located within EvoStar with three related conferences: EuroGP, EvoCOP and EvoMUSART.

The aim of EvoApplications is to create a friendly environment that can lead to the establishment or strengthening of scientific collaborations and exchanges among attendees.

Therefore, EvoApplications solicits high-quality original research papers (including significant work-in-progress) on any aspect of applications of Evolutionary Computation, both to real-world or methodological contexts in which Evolutionary Computation can contribute to pushing the limits of the state of the art beyond the present ones.

We encourage you to submit papers focused on interesting, relevant and original works that are related to all kinds of applications of Evolutionary Computation.
