DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _T_r_e_e  is a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth indented listing of files, which is col‐
       orized ala _d_i_r_c_o_l_o_r_s if the LLSS__CCOOLLOORRSS environment variable is set and output is to tty.  With  no  arguments,
       _t_r_e_e  lists the files in the current directory.  When directory arguments are given, _t_r_e_e lists all the files
       and/or directories found in the given directories each in turn.  Upon completion of listing all  files/direc‐
       tories found, _t_r_e_e returns the total number of files and/or directories listed.

       By  default,  when a symbolic link is encountered, the path that the symbolic link refers to is printed after
       the name of the link in the format:

           name -> real-path

       If the `--ll' option is given and the symbolic link refers to an actual directory, then _t_r_e_e  will  follow  the
       path of the symbolic link as if it were a real directory.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       _T_r_e_e understands the following command line switches:

LLIISSTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aa     All  files are printed.  By default tree does not print hidden files (those beginning with a dot `.').
              In no event does tree print the file system constructs `.' (current directory) and `..' (previous  di‐
              rectory).

       --dd     List directories only.

       --ll     Follows  symbolic links if they point to directories, as if they were directories. Symbolic links that
              will result in recursion are avoided when detected.

       --ff     Prints the full path prefix for each file.

       --xx     Stay on the current file-system only.  Ala ffiinndd _-_x_d_e_v..

       --LL _l_e_v_e_l
              Max display depth of the directory tree.

       --RR     Recursively cross down the tree each _l_e_v_e_l directories (see --LL option), and at each  of  them  execute
              ttrreeee again adding `-o 00Tree.html' as a new option.

       --PP _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              List only those files that match the wild-card _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.  Note: you must use the _-_a option to also con‐
              sider those files beginning with a dot `.'  for matching.  Valid wildcard operators are `*' (any  zero
              or more characters), `?' (any single character), `[...]' (any single character listed between brackets
              (optional - (dash) for character range may be used: ex: [A-Z]), and `[^...]' (any single character not
              listed in brackets) and `|' separates alternate patterns.

       --II _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              Do not list those files that match the wild-card _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.

       ----iiggnnoorree--ccaassee
              If  a  match pattern is specified by the --PP or --II option, this will cause the pattern to match without
              regards to the case of each letter.

       ----mmaattcchhddiirrss
              If a match pattern is specified by the --PP option, this will cause the pattern to be applied to  direc‐
              tory  names  (in  addition  to filenames).  In the event of a match on the directory name, matching is
              disabled for the directory's contents. If the ----pprruunnee option is used, empty  folders  that  match  the
              pattern will not be pruned.

       ----pprruunnee
              Makes  tree  prune  empty  directories from the output, useful when used in conjunction with --PP or --II.
              See BBUUGGSS AANNDD NNOOTTEESS below for more information on this option.

       ----nnoorreeppoorrtt
              Omits printing of the file and directory report at the end of the tree listing.

       ----cchhaarrsseett _c_h_a_r_s_e_t
              Set the character set to use when outputting HTML and for line drawing.

       ----ffiilleelliimmiitt _#
              Do not descend directories that contain more than _# entries.

       ----ttiimmeeffmmtt _f_o_r_m_a_t
              Prints (implies -D) and formats the date according to the format string  which  uses  the  ssttrrffttiimmee(3)
              syntax.

       --oo _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e
              Send output to _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --qq     Print non-printable characters in filenames as question marks instead of the default.

       --NN     Print non-printable characters as is instead of as escaped octal numbers.

       --QQ     Quote the names of files in double quotes.

       --pp     Print the file type and permissions for each file (as per ls -l).

       --uu     Print the username, or UID # if no username is available, of the file.

       --gg     Print the group name, or GID # if no group name is available, of the file.

       --ss     Print the size of each file in bytes along with the name.

       --hh     Print  the  size of each file but in a more human readable way, e.g. appending a size letter for kilo‐
              bytes (K), megabytes (M), gigabytes (G), terabytes (T), petabytes (P) and exabytes (E).

       ----ssii   Like --hh but use SI units (powers of 1000) instead.

       ----dduu   For each directory report its size as the accumulation of sizes of all its files  and  sub-directories
              (and  their files, and so on).  The total amount of used space is also given in the final report (like
              the 'du -c' command.) This option requires tree to read the entire directory tree before emitting  it,
              see BBUUGGSS AANNDD NNOOTTEESS below.  Implies --ss.

       --DD     Print  the  date  of  the last modification time or if --cc is used, the last status change time for the
              file listed.

       --FF     Append a `/' for directories, a `=' for socket files, a `*' for executable files, a `>' for doors (So‐
              laris) and a `|' for FIFO's, as per ls -F

       ----iinnooddeess
              Prints the inode number of the file or directory

       ----ddeevviiccee
              Prints the device number to which the file or directory belongs

SSOORRTTIINNGG OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --vv     Sort the output by version.

       --tt     Sort the output by last modification time instead of alphabetically.

       --cc     Sort  the output by last status change instead of alphabetically.  Modifies the --DD option (if used) to
              print the last status change instead of modification time.

       --UU     Do not sort.  Lists files in directory order. Disables ----ddiirrssffiirrsstt.

       --rr     Sort the output in reverse order.  This is a meta-sort that alter the above  sorts.   This  option  is
              disabled when --UU is used.

       ----ddiirrssffiirrsstt
              List  directories  before files. This is a meta-sort that alters the above sorts.  This option is dis‐
              abled when --UU is used.

       ----ssoorrtt[==]_t_y_p_e
              Sort the output by _t_y_p_e instead of name. Possible values are: ccttiimmee (--cc), mmttiimmee (--tt)),, ssiizzee, or vveerrssiioonn
              (--vv))..

GGRRAAPPHHIICCSS OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ii     Makes  tree not print the indentation lines, useful when used in conjunction with the --ff option.  Also
              removes as much whitespace as possible when used with the --JJ or --xx options.

       --AA     Turn on ANSI line graphics hack when printing the indentation lines.

       --SS     Turn on CP437 line graphics (useful when using Linux console mode fonts). This option is  now  equiva‐
              lent to `--charset=IBM437' and may eventually be depreciated.

       --nn     Turn colorization off always, over-ridden by the --CC option.

       --CC     Turn colorization on always, using built-in color defaults if the LS_COLORS or TREE_COLORS environment
              variables are not set.  Useful to colorize output to a pipe.

XXMMLL//JJSSOONN//HHTTMMLL OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --XX     Turn on XML output. Outputs the directory tree as an XML formatted file.

       --JJ     Turn on JSON output. Outputs the directory tree as an JSON formatted array.

       --HH _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F
              Turn on HTML output, including HTTP references. Useful for ftp sites.  _b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F gives the base ftp lo‐
              cation  when  using  HTML output. That is, the local directory may be `/local/ftp/pub', but it must be
              referenced as `ftp://hostname.organization.domain/pub' (_b_a_s_e_H_R_E_F should  be  `ftp://hostname.organiza‐
              tion.domain').  Hint: don't use ANSI lines with this option, and don't give more than one directory in
              the directory list. If you wish to use colors via CSS style-sheet, use the -C option  in  addition  to
              this option to force color output.

       --TT _t_i_t_l_e
              Sets the title and H1 header string in HTML output mode.

       ----nnoolliinnkkss
              Turns off hyperlinks in HTML output.

IINNPPUUTT OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ----ffrroommffiillee  Reads a directory listing from a file rather than the file-system.  Paths provided on the command
       line are files to read from rather than directories to search.  The dot (.)  directory  indicates  that  tree
       should read paths from standard input.

MMIISSCC OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       ----hheellpp Outputs a verbose usage listing.

       ----vveerrssiioonn
              Outputs the version of tree.

       ----     Option processing terminator.  No further options will be processed after this.

       Tree  does  not prune "empty" directories when the -P and -I options are used by default. Use the --prune op‐
       tion.

       The -h and --si options round to the nearest whole number unlike the ls implementations which rounds  up  al‐
       ways.

       Pruning  files  and directories with the -I, -P and --filelimit options will lead to incorrect file/directory
       count reports.

       The --prune and --du options cause tree to accumulate the entire tree in memory before emitting it. For large
       directory trees this can cause a significant delay in output and the use of large amounts of memory.

       The  timefmt  expansion  buffer  is  limited  to a ridiculously large 255 characters.  Output of time strings
       longer than this will be undefined, but are guaranteed to not exceed 255 characters.

       XML/JSON trees are not colored, which is a bit of a shame.

       Probably more.
